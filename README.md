# CS410 - Software Reverse Engineering

<p>
This repository contains the work that was completed during my semester learning software reverse engineering at SNHU. The focus of this course was to understand how C++ code is converted into x86 Assembly. We were required to develop an intimate understanding of x86 assembly, and how assembly operations complete work that is required from the higher level language used to write the initial code.
